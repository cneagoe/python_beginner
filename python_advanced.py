# ADVANCED EXERCISES :
# EXERCISE : 1 
    # Calculate the day of the week for a given date.
	# MENTOR NOTE : if they are comfortable googling you can let them find the formula 
        # if not here is an example they can implement
		# - 1st April 1983: Here k = 1 m=2 D=83 C=19.
		# - Putting the values in the formula, we get, F= 1+ [(13*2-1)/5] +83+83/4+19/4-2*19 = 1+ [(26-1)/5]+83+20.75+4.75-38 = 1+25+83+20+4-38                 (discarding the decimal values) = 133-38 = 75
		# - After calculating F divide it by 7 and get the remainder.
		# - 78/7=11 Quotient 5-Remainder
		# - Therefore, the day on 1st April 1983 was Friday since the remainder is 5.

# EXERCISE : 2 
    # google how to read and write to a file
    # - create 10 files each containing the same number written down 10 times
    # - for example file1 would contain the number 1 written down 10 times, file2 the number 2 and so on

# EXERCISE : 4 
    # print the first 100 numbers fibonacci sequence 
    # (without for loops if there's a worthy challanger)

# EXERCISE : 5
    # order a list of numbers in ascending order

# EXERCISE : 6
    # Calculate the number of days between two dates
